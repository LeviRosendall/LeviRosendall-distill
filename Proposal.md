Project Overview:
From July 31 to October 8, I ran an ETSY shop selling BELIEVE signs from the Apple TV+ show ‘Ted Lasso’. 
For my project I would like to not only map where I sent signs, but also do some analysis on the locations within the United States where I shipped. 
Something I am thinking about is how many signs were sent to (zipcode, county, state) vs the income of that place. 
The income data will come from US Census Data.

Plan of Action:
Create an animated map of where I have shipped
Create tables/correlations between ship area vs income
Compile the above into a website that makes viewing my project results easy

Comments:
Maybe you could also look at where signs sold first versus where they tend to sell now? So see if a portion of the US was more into the show before a different area?
This is a really neat project though and I'm excited to see what you find out (and that animated map is gonna be so cool)!
